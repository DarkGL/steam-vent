# Steam-Vent

Forked from https://github.com/icewind1991/steam-vent to add methods for logins and a set of helper methods for sending messages.

### Interact with the Steam network via rust

Allows communication with the steam servers using the same protocol as the regular steam client.

## Usage

Note that this project is still in early development and api's might see large changes.

## Credit

This is in large parts inspired by and based of [@DoctorMcKay's](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay) work on [SteamUser](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/),
massive credits go to all who worked on that.
