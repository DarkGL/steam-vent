# steam-vent

Forked from https://github.com/icewind1991/steam-vent to add methods for logins and a set of helper methods for sending messages such as sending chat messages, as well as methods for interacting with the game coordinator.

### Interact with the Steam network via Rust

Allows communication with the Steam servers using the same protocol as the regular Steam client.

Note that this project is still in early development. Currently, basic tasks require much more effort than needed. This is likely to be changed for easier interfacing to take care of redundant tasks, such as web authentication and managing friend list state. All help is appreciated.

### Usage

See [examples](./examples).
